/** @brief Component ids (values) for the different types and instances of onboard hardware/software that might make up a MAVLink system (autopilot, cameras, servos, GPS systems, avoidance systems etc.).
      Components must use the appropriate ID in their source address when sending messages. Components can also use IDs to determine if they are the intended recipient of an incoming message. The MAV_COMP_ID_ALL value is used to indicate messages that must be processed by all components.
      When creating new entries, components that can have multiple instances (e.g. cameras, servos etc.) should be allocated sequential values. An appropriate number of values should be left free after these components to allow the number of instances to be expanded. */

          Param1 (id) may be used to specify the target camera: 0: all cameras, 1 to 6: autopilot-connected cameras, 7-255: MAVLink camera component ID.
          It is needed in order to target specific cameras connected to the autopilot, or specific sensors in a multi-sensor camera (neither of which have a distinct MAVLink component ID).
          It is also needed to specify the target camera in missions.

          When used in a mission, an autopilot should execute the MAV_CMD for a specified local camera (param1 = 1-6), or resend it as a command if it is intended for a MAVLink camera (param1 = 7 - 255), setting the command's target_component as the param1 value (and setting param1 in the command to zero).
          If the param1 is 0 the autopilot should do both.

          When sent in a command the target MAVLink address is set using target_component.
          If addressed specifically to an autopilot: param1 should be used in the same way as it is for missions (though command should NACK with MAV_RESULT_DENIED if a specified local camera does not exist).
          If addressed to a MAVLink camera, param 1 can be used to address all cameras (0), or to separately address 1 to 7 individual sensors. Other values should be NACKed with MAV_RESULT_DENIED.

          It is also needed to specify the target camera in missions.

          When used in a mission, an autopilot should execute the MAV_CMD for a specified local camera (param1 = 1-6), or resend it as a command if it is intended for a MAVLink camera (param1 = 7 - 255), setting the command's target_component as the param1 value (and setting param1 in the command to zero).
          If the param1 is 0 the autopilot should do both.

          When sent in a command the target MAVLink address is set using target_component.
